Provenance in Games

Provenance in Games is a proposed conceptual framework that collects information during a game session and maps it to provenance terms, using digital provenance concepts for representing the game flow, and providing the means for a post-game analysis. The goal of this work is to improve the playerâ€™s understanding of the game flow, providing insights on how the story progressed and the influences in the outcome. In order to improve understanding, this conceptual framework provides the means for analyzing the game flow by using provenance.

The provenance analysis is done by processing collected gameplay data and generating a provenance graph, which relates the actions and events that occurred during the game session. This provenance graph might allow the player, or a third person, such as a mentor, to identify critical actions that influenced the game outcome and helps to understand how events were generated and which decisions influenced them. This process may also aid in the identification of mistakes, allowing the player to reflect upon them for future interactions.

The Provenance in Games conceptual framework was initially instantiated in the Software Development Manager (SDM) game as a proof of concept. The SDM game focuses on introducing Software Engineering concepts and skills to undergraduate students. The version of SDM with provenance support makes use of the conceptual framework for collecting provenance and can be viewed by using Prov Viewer, an integral tool for visualizing the provenance graph.
